### **Project Overview**

**Fling Ping** is a mobile app designed to revolutionize sexual health management by providing anonymous, private, and fun tools for staying informed and proactive. The app facilitates secure connections between users, rapid exposure notifications, and access to educational resources, all while prioritizing user privacy.

**Core Objectives:**

1. Ensure total anonymity for users with encrypted, privacy-first technology.
2. Provide seamless functionality for creating anonymous "Ping Points" between partners.
3. Deliver discreet, real-time notifications about potential STD exposure.
4. Offer engaging and educational resources to promote smarter sexual health decisions.

### **Scope of Work**

### **Core Features (MVP)**

1. **Ping Points System**:
    - Enable users to create anonymous, encrypted connections via:
        - **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** proximity detection.
        - **QR Code or NFC** pairing options.
    - Generate unique, timestamped random IDs (Ping Points) that link securely.
2. **Exposure Notifications**:
    - Daily scans of a secure, anonymized database to detect potential exposure.
    - Notify users with discreet alerts, e.g., "You may have been exposed. Learn more."
    - Include verified diagnosis reporting through healthcare integration in future phases.
3. **Privacy Features**:
    - End-to-end encryption for all data in transit.
    - Data minimization: No names, emails, or personal identifiers stored.
    - Allow users to delete Ping Points or deactivate their account completely.
4. **Educational Resource Library**:
    - Include FAQs, quick tips, and resource guides.
    - Provide links to nearby testing centers and sexual health organizations.
5. **User Onboarding and Dashboard**:
    - Simple, fun onboarding experience that highlights privacy features.
    - Dashboard to view notifications, manage Ping Points, and access resources.

### **Key Screens**

1. **Onboarding**:
    - Highlight core features like privacy, Ping Points, and notifications.
    - Use illustrations and animations to keep it engaging.
2. **Ping Points**:
    - Clear interface for connecting via BLE, QR, or NFC.
    - Visual feedback (e.g., ping animations) upon successful connection.
3. **Notifications**:
    - Minimalistic alert design with discreet phrasing, e.g., "Potential exposure detected."
4. **Resource Library**:
    - Categorized educational content with a search bar.
5. **User Dashboard**:
